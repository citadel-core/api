# Citadel API

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/runcitadel/manager/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=9WJ88AUTB9)](https://codecov.io/github/runcitadel/manager)

This is the main backend of Citadel that handles:

- User authentication using JWT
- Encryption/decryption of sensitive information, such as the lightning wallet's seed
- CRUD operations
- Lifecycle-management of all other containerized services
- Communication with Bitcoind and Electrs

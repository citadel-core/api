[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/runcitadel/manager/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=9WJ88AUTB9)](https://codecov.io/github/runcitadel/manager)

Manager provides a low-level system API that handles:
- User authentication using JWT
- Encryption/decryption of sensitive information, such as the lightning wallet's seed
- CRUD operations

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Citadel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
